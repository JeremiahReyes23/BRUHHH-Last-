      <h3>Pixlr</h3>
      <p>I got into Pixlr to mess around and figure out how it works. Ended up using it to tweak and create cool images. Gathered a bunch of photos that meant something to me and threw them together for a personal project. Messing with Pixlr not only showed me some neat tricks but also helped me express myself through a meaningful art piece. It's become my go-to for messing around with digital creativity.</p>

      <h4>Personal Website</h4>
      <p>I learned with BSD to code this website and put my newfound skills to use in creating an art-focused site. The website dives into the history of art, covering everything from ancient cave paintings to the contemporary use of technology and AI. Using BSD not only helped me build the site but also allowed me to showcase my coding abilities in a project that's all about creativity and art exploration. It's like turning my coding skills into a canvas for sharing the fascinating journey of art through the ages.</p>

      <h6>Production Test</h6>
      <p>I was tasked to take a template and give it a modern appeal by uploading fresh text and images. The website was all about technology, and I had fun working on it. I enjoyed following through the document, adding new text, and really diving into creating a detailed services page. Before it wasn't really informative and needed to be easy to navigate, with strategic planning I was able to accomplish revitalzing a website.</p>

      <h4>Arc GIS</h4>
      <p>Exploring GIS, I gained insights into its versatile applications and user practices. Discovering the diverse visual perspectives offered by different views was interesting. This experience broadened my understanding of GIS, highlighting its multifaceted approach to data visualization. It was a valuable oppertunity that emphasized the platform's capacity for engaging and varied visuals, extending its utility beyond traditional mapping.
